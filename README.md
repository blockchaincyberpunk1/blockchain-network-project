# Blockchain Network Project

The Blockchain Network Project is a comprehensive solution designed to demonstrate the fundamental components of a blockchain-based system. This project encompasses a backend built with Node.js, Express, and additional libraries for blockchain functionalities, as well as a frontend developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive user interfaces. The core features include a blockchain explorer, wallet services, a faucet for token requests, and mining simulation.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: backend and frontend.

**Backend**: Contains all server-side logic, blockchain implementation, APIs for blockchain interaction, wallet services, and miner simulation. It is developed using Node.js and Express.

**Frontend**: Consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to provide an interactive user interface for the blockchain explorer, wallet services, and other features. It communicates with the backend through API calls.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blockchaincyberpunk1/blockchain-network-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-network-project
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:

Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the necessary configurations.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

7. Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the frontend application.


## Features

- **Blockchain Explorer**: Allows users to view the latest blocks and transactions on the blockchain. It provides detailed information about each block and transaction.

- **Wallet Service**: Enables users to create a new wallet, view their balance, send transactions, and see their transaction history.
  
- **Faucet**: Provides a mechanism for users to request tokens for testing purposes. It includes rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

- **Miner Simulation**: Simulates the mining process, allowing users to understand how new blocks are mined and added to the blockchain.
